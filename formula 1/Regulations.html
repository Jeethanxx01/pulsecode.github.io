                <h2><a href="https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/110">Sporting Regulations</a></h2>
                <p>Sporting regulations govern various aspects of race procedures, driver conduct, penalties, and more. They include rules on race start procedures, safety car deployments, and race interruptions. Driver behavior and on-track conduct are also addressed, with penalties for unsportsmanlike behavior. Rules related to overtaking, pit stops, and tire usage are essential for strategizing during a race. Qualifying format and penalties, such as grid drops and time penalties, are part of sporting regulations.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/110">Technical Regulations</a></h2>
                <p>Technical regulations cover the design and specifications of Formula 1 cars, including dimensions, weight, aerodynamics, and engine power. They dictate the maximum car dimensions, minimum weight, and regulations on the car's safety structures. Aerodynamic rules limit the design of wings, diffusers, and other bodywork to control downforce and airflow. Engine regulations focus on power unit development, energy recovery systems, and limitations on fuel usage. Hybrid systems, transmission, and exhaust are also governed by technical regulations.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/110">Financial Regulations</a></h2>
                <p>Financial regulations deal with financial aspects, such as cost caps and financial fair play rules, aimed at ensuring financial sustainability and fairness in the sport. The cost cap limits the amount teams can spend on specific components and operational expenses. Financial fair play rules aim to promote financial stability, prevent excessive spending, and maintain competitive balance. Rules also cover prize money distribution, revenue sharing, and sponsorship agreements. Financial transparency and auditing processes are crucial in enforcing these regulations.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/110">Related Regulations</a></h2>
                <p>Related regulations may include rules concerning team management, testing, safety, media, and other aspects not covered explicitly in other segments. Team management rules govern the registration process, ownership, and personnel eligibility within a team. Testing regulations control the number of test days, permitted testing venues, and the use of current cars. Safety regulations are critical for driver and spectator protection, covering circuits, barriers, and medical facilities. Media rules manage media access, press conferences, and content distribution during race weekends.</p>
