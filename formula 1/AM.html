<p>Aston Martin is a British car manufacturer that has participated in Formula One in various forms and is currently racing in F1 under the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team name. The company first participated in Formula One during the 1959 season where they debuted the DBR4 chassis using their own engine but it failed to score any points. They continued to perform poorly through the 1960 season, once again failing to score any points. As a result, Aston Martin decided to leave Formula One after 1960.A commercial rebranding of the Racing Point F1 Team resulted in the team's return as Aston Martin in 2021, utilising customer Mercedes power units. In 2026, the team will begin using Honda power units as part of a works partnership with the Japanese manufacturer. The team, owned by Lawrence Stroll, has Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll as their race drivers beginning with the 2023 season. The team is headquartered in Silverstone and has previously raced under various different names, starting with Jordan Grand Prix in 1991. </p>
