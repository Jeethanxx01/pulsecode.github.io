            <h2>KERS in formula 1</h2>
            <p>
                KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) and ERS (Energy Recovery System) are Formula 1 technologies that harness and reuse energy. KERS, previously used, captured braking energy to provide a power boost. ERS, the modern version, harvests heat from both brakes and exhaust, feeding it into a hybrid power unit for added acceleration, enhancing efficiency and race strategy.

            <h2>Energy Recovery Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Energy Recovery Systems (ERS) in Formula 1 capture and reuse wasted energy. The system includes MGU-K, which converts kinetic energy during braking into electrical energy, and MGU-H, which harvests heat energy from exhaust gases. The stored energy is later deployed for extra power, boosting acceleration and efficiency while racing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Box 12 -->
        <div class="box">
            <img src="i12.jpg" alt="Box 12 Image">
            <h2>Aero-Wheel Covers</h2>
            <p>
               Aero-wheel covers in Formula 1 are streamlined coverings placed over the wheels to improve aerodynamic efficiency. These covers reduce turbulence around the spinning wheels, minimizing drag and enhancing overall airflow around the car. However, as of my last update in September 2021, such covers weren't yet a standard feature due to ongoing discussions about their impact on racing and safety.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Box 13 -->
        <div class="box">

            <h2>Drag Reduction System (DRS)</h2>
            <p>
                The Drag Reduction System (DRS) in Formula 1 is a technology that reduces aerodynamic drag and enhances overtaking. It involves an adjustable flap on the rear wing. Drivers can activate DRS in designated zones when they're closely following another car. This reduces downforce, allowing for higher speeds and easier overtaking due to decreased air resistance.
            </p>
        </div>
